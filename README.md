# About

Hello and welcome to my simple employee scheduler application. This project uses MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js as the core technologies. Originally I wanted this to be a basic and lightweight CRUD application to showcase to potential employers, but decided to go down the rabbit hole and keep it as an ongoing work in progress as I think of additional features and tweaks to implement.

## Usage

[Live Demo](https://joecooler21.github.io/react-scheduler-app/)

It's pretty straight forward. You can view, add, edit and remove employee and shift information just by clicking on a date in the calender. All changes occur in realtime, so no having to save manually. You can also click any day of the week and view that weeks schedule laid out in a nice clean printable format.
