# About

Hello and welcome to my simple employee scheduler application. This project uses MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js as the core technologies. Originally I wanted this to be a basic and lightweight CRUD application to showcase to potential employers, but decided to go down the rabbit hole and keep it as an ongoing work in progress as I think of additional features and tweaks to implement.

## Usage

[Live Demo](https://joecooler21.github.io/react-scheduler-app/)

It's pretty straight forward. Available employees and shifts can be added and removed. Schedule information can be viewed and modified just by clicking on a date in on the calender. All changes happen in real time, so no manual saves are needed. Also, if you need a printer-friendly weekly schedule, you can click on any day of that week and hit the purple printer button.
